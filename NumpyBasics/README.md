# About Numpy
It is the python library to conduct easy matrix operations, matrices are used a lot in machine learning so we need numpy to handle them easily, else we have to write nested loops for even the simplest things
# NUMPY BASICS
Here I have tried to cover sum basic functions of Numpy which one must know because they are used very often. 
# What Next
Go through the documentation of Numpy and implement some more functions if you like
