# NUMPY STACK
these are some resources from where one can learn the basic libraries. 
which are used in machine learning and deep learning in python
For machine learning one needs to handle matrices which is done using `numpy`
we need to handle datasets which is done using the `pandas` library 
The data visuaization is handled using the `matplotlib` library
A basic introduction to machine learning is also tried using the `sklearn` lib

# Why python
machine learning and data science requires a lot of maths so why not use languages like `matlab`
the main reason for that is that at present we are using machine learning to develop various products 
thus it would be better to use a language which has better support in product development like a language
which is used to build servers for websites would be appropriate. Python is used in various fields, it is used
for web development, for hacking, etc
Also Python is a very easy language to get started with, its syntaxes are not as complicated as that of Java
and it has built a pretty decent community
Therefore Python got popular for machine learning
# TOPICS COVERED
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. SciKit learn
# Dependencies 
The files in the project are python notebooks
The first dependency is `python3`
Python3 is being used because there are many libraries that do not support `python2`
The following are the list of dependecies for understanding and working on the files in the project-
1. `jupyter notebook`: maximum files in the repo are python noteboooks which can be used and worked using jupyter notebook
you can install python notebook in mac and linux using the given command in the terminal 
`pip3 install jupyter`
2. `Numpy`: numpy is used for mathematical processing, it can be installed using 
`pip3 install numpy`
3. `matplotlib`: used for the purpose of visualization, install using 
`pip3 install matplotlib`
4. `scikit-learn`: It is the easiest machine learning library available, it is very easy to use for the beginners, install using `pip3 install -U scikit-learn`
but inorder to install scikit learn one must already have installed `numpy` and `scipy`
scipy installation: `pip3 install scipy`
